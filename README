Workout
=======

this module provides a unique interface to data files used for recording
cycling workouts (especially wattage based).

These import/-export modules are "chained" together with filters for
merging, converting and/or analyzing the data. 

Please start with 'perldoc Workout' to get an overview on how this library
works.

Please take a look at the executables (wkdump, wkinfo, wkconv, wkmerge,
... ) to get some examples.
